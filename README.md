# Traffic Sign Detection Project

## Overview
This project aims to develop an image classification system for detecting traffic signs using machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning algorithms. The goal is to enhance road safety by automating the detection and recognition of various types of traffic signs commonly found on roads.
